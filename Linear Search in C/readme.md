# C Program to Implement Linear Search

 A <b>C</b> Program which finds the position of an element in an array using Linear Search Algorithm. We have to take an array and a value to be searched in the array as input from the user, and then find the position of that element in array by using linear search algorithm.

 ## Expected Input and Output

 1. Average Case: If the searched element is other than the first and the last element of the array. For example:

    ```C
    If the input array is: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
    And the element to be searched is: 5
    Then the output should be: 4
    ```
  <b>Average case time complexity: O(n)</b>
  
 2. Best Case: If the searched element is the first element of the array. For example:
    
    ```C
    If the input array is {4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 3}
    and if the element searched is 4,
    then the expected output will be Position 0.
    ```
  <b>Best case time complexity: O(1)</b>
  
  3. Worst Case: If the searched element is the last element of the array. For example:
    
  ```C
  If the input array is {4, 6, 1, 2, 5, 3}
  and if the element searched is 3,
  then the expected output will be Position 5.
  ```
  <b>Worst case time complexity: O(n)</b>
